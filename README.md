Delphi add-in that provides functionality specific to macOS and iOS development

Support for Delphi 10.3.x Rio and Delphi 10.4 Sydney

Select the desired SDK that you wish to import frameworks for, then select the desired frameworks, and click Add. 

The SDK Manager in the IDE Options is then presented. Click Update Local File Cache and click Save to complete the import

#### Show Deployed App

Opens Finder on the Mac, and shows the deployed app (if it has been deployed)

#### Update Assets.car

**NOTE: The following instructions apply to Mosco Expert 1.0.0 Beta 8 or later, and Mosco App (for macOS) 1.0.2 Beta 5 or later**

Updates the Assets.car file in the deployment to Ad-Hoc or App Store.

This function has been created specifically to alleviate an issue with [App Store submissions where a 1024 x 1024 icon is not included with the app](https://quality.embarcadero.com/browse/RSP-29692)

**You will need to create a 1024 x 1024 image for use in the App Store and add it using Deployment Manager**

To update the Assets.car file, deploy the app in App Store or Ad Hoc mode (using Project|Deploy), then use the Update Assets.car menu item

The Assets.car file is based upon the icon and launch images deployed with the app. For successful creation of Assets.car, your deployment should contain at least **one** image of each of the following sizes:

* 40 x 40
* 58 x 58
* 60 x 60
* 80 x 80
* 87 x 87
* 120 x 120
* 152 x 152
* 167 x 167
* 180 x 180
* 1024 x 1024

The Assets.car file inside the application IPA file on the Mac is automatically replaced by Mosco.


### Functions that will work whether or not the Mosco macOS app is running:

#### Select Profile 

Instantly switches between connection profiles

#### Select SDK 

Instantly switches between SDKs
